        <!-- Biography -->
        <p>I was born in a log cabin on the moon on Dec 33rd. I had a relatively normal childhood but one day I jumped to high and began a slow float to earth. Entering the atmosphere was rather hot, but I had dressed in multiple layers that day so I just took a few off and was fine. After landing I adopted a human moniker and tried my best to blend in, and that brings us up to the present.</p>
